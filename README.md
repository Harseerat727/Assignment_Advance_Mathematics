# Learning Probability Density Functions 
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation for **Assignment-1**, which focuses on understanding probability density functions through a **non-linear data transformation** applied to real-world air quality data.

The assignment demonstrates how statistical modeling techniques can be applied after transforming raw data using a roll-number-dependent function. The goal is to analyze the distribution of the transformed data and learn the parameters of a given probability density function.

## Dataset
- **Name:** India Air Quality Data  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutibhargava94/india-air-quality-data  
- **Feature Used:** NO₂ (Nitrogen Dioxide concentration)

Only the NO₂ feature is considered for this assignment.

## Objective
The objectives of this assignment are:
- To apply a roll-number-parameterized non-linear transformation to air quality data
- To model the probability distribution of the transformed variable
- To estimate the parameters of the given probability density function
- To gain hands-on experience with probabilistic modeling using real-world data

## Methodology (High-Level)
- Real-world air quality data is loaded and preprocessed
- A non-linear transformation function is applied to the NO₂ values
- A probability density function is fitted to the transformed data
- Model parameters are estimated using statistical techniques

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for optional visualization)
